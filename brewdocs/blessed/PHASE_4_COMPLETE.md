- **Easy Switching:** `/model <name>` command for instant model changes
- **Comprehensive Help:** Full model listing with descriptions

### **Enhanced Confirmation UX**
✅ **Flexible Input:**
- `Y` or `Enter` = Yes (multiple ways to confirm)
- `N` = No (single keystroke)  
- `A` = Yes to all (session-wide approval)
- `Esc` = Cancel (instant exit)
- **Visual Feedback:** Emojis and color-coded decisions

### **Enterprise Task Management** (`/task` command family)
✅ **Complete Task System:**
- `/task add <title> <description>` - Create new tasks
- `/task list` - Display all tasks with status icons
- `/task focus <id>` - Focus on specific task
- `/task complete <id>` - Mark tasks as completed
- `/task plan` - Show current task plan overview
- **Priority Support:** HIGH/MED/LOW with color coding
- **Status Tracking:** PLANNING/IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED
- **Real-time Updates:** Instant task status changes

### **Industry-Grade Performance System**
✅ **Smart Deduplication:**
- 100ms window for high-frequency events
- Type-aware deduplication strategies
- Memory-efficient LRU cache (500 entries)
- Performance monitoring and statistics

✅ **Intelligent Event Collapsing:**
- Related operations grouped together
- Visual counters for repeated events
- "X more" indicators for grouped items
- Performance impact tracking

✅ **Large Content Optimization:**
- Virtualization for >1000 lines or >50KB
- Progressive chunk loading with "..." indicators
- Non-blocking async rendering
- Memory usage optimization

✅ **Production Architecture:**
